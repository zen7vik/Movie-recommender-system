# Movie-recommender-system
Recommender system that uses TMDB-5000 dataset and cosine distance to recommend similar movies.
Used streamlit to make a web-app and pushed it on heroku for hosting.

NOTE: Create similarity.pkl using pickle for usig it with streamlit, otherwise your webapp won't work.(P.S. File size was too large to upload.)
